For security reason GaelO interface do not contains (yet) deletion capabalities of data.
Available "deletion" function in GaelO mark data as 'deleted' but do not really delete them to make them recoverable

If you want to make real deletion of a study you have to :

- Get stored Orthanc Series ID related to that Study and remove them from Orthanc-Pacs

SELECT `study_orthanc_id` FROM `orthanc_studies` WHERE `id_visit` IN (SELECT id_visit from visits WHERE study="etude1")

- Manually edit the database as follow  :

Remove all specific table of the study, to list them : 
SELECT `table_review_specific` FROM `visit_type` WHERE `study`="etude1"
And Make DROP TABLE tableSpecificName for each table

Remove database entries in this order
DELETE FROM `reviews` WHERE `id_visit` IN (SELECT id_visit from visits WHERE study="etude1");
DELETE FROM `tracker` WHERE `id_visit` IN (SELECT id_visit from visits WHERE study="etude1") OR `study`="etude1";
DELETE FROM `documentation` WHERE `study`="etude1";
DELETE FROM `roles` WHERE `study`="etude1";
DELETE FROM `orthanc_series` WHERE ( orthanc_series.Study_UID IN (SELECT orthanc_studies.Study_UID FROM orthanc_studies WHERE id_visit IN ( SELECT id_visit from visits WHERE study="etude1") ));
DELETE FROM `orthanc_studies` WHERE `id_visit` IN (SELECT id_visit from visits WHERE study="etude1");
DELETE FROM `visits` WHERE `study`="etude1";
DELETE FROM `patients` WHERE `study`="etude1";
DELETE FROM `visit_type` WHERE `study`="etude1";
DELETE FROM `studies` WHERE `name`="etude1";
